## Introduction
> <b>I am a member of the BCG GAMMA Data Science team, and have been tasked with the responsibility of investigating deeper the hypothesis of the BCG GAMMA client, PowerCO; that the customer churn that the business is experiencing is driven by their customer's price sensitivity. <b/>

## Objectives
> <b>The following are the objectives of this project:
> - <b>Diagnose the source of the client's churning customers; with a focus on the SME segment, by digging deep into the client's hypothesis that the churning is driven by customer's price sensitivity.<b/>
>
> - <b>Then procede to building a working predictive model to know which customers are likely to church at the current price.<b/>

## The Business Background
> <b>PowerCO is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate,  SME(Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to a significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment.
>
> PowerCo has partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

## The Business Scenario
> <b>The partnership that this business has with BCG GAMMA would have BCG GAMMA investigate and diagnose the business customer churning challenge.
>
> <b>The client, PowerCO acknowledges that the customer church problem is driven by the power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe, and the churn problem is largely significant in the business SME customer segment.
>
> <b>PowerCO would like to explore the possibility of predicting the customers that likely to churn using a predictive model. PowerCO also believes as an hypothesis that the churn is driven by customers price sensitity.
>
> <b>It is noteworthy to mention that the head of SME division is considering and proposing that the business offers the customers that are churn risk an incentivising discount of 20% which is large enough to disuade anyone from churning, especially those for whom price is a primary concern.
